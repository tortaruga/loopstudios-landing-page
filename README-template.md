## Overview

Sass would make my life easier, they said. Snickering devils. One afternoon of desperate fighting only to INSTALL the damn thing. To understand how to use it. Not LEARN how to use it, mind you, no, that part is still too far away for our grasping, just how the hell do I set this mothertucker up? and why won't it let itself be installed? and is it necessary to install it by the way? and what is Koala? and how do I activate this Live Sass extension? why is everything so complicated? 

But the final result is not that bad. There's no room for medium sized screens, it only looks good on small screens or big screens, but that's an issue for another day.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM 
- Sass

### What I learned

FIrst time using Sass, learned about its features and syntax. It didn't make my coding faster, but that's probably because I'm not familiar with it yet. The final css is some fifty lines longer, which is not bad although I expected a bigger difference. But I'm probably not using Sass as well as I should.

### Continued development

I'm still not that good at BEM, and Sass obviously, and clearly grids are still a pain in the ribs, and for some reason this time even simple things decided to refuse to work, but at least the mobile menu was not a nightmare this time.
